# Cloudinary Setup Guide for VPS Deployment

## üîß Problem: Image Upload Not Working

If product image uploads are failing on your deployed site, it's likely because Cloudinary environment variables are not configured on your VPS server.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Configure Cloudinary on Your VPS

### Step 1: Get Your Cloudinary Credentials

1. Go to [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) and sign in (or create an account)
2. Navigate to your **Dashboard**
3. Copy these values:
   - **Cloud Name** (e.g., `yuumpy-cloud`)
   - **API Key** (e.g., `123456789012345`)
   - **API Secret** (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables on Your VPS (Cloudpanel)

1. **Log in to Cloudpanel** on your VPS
2. Navigate to your **Node.js site solution** (yuumpy)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add these three environment variables:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace the placeholder values with your actual Cloudinary credentials
- Do NOT include quotes around the values
- Make sure there are no extra spaces

### Step 3: Restart Your Node.js Application

After adding the environment variables:

1. In Cloudpanel, go to your **Node.js site**
2. Click **Restart** or **Reload**
3. Wait for the application to restart (usually takes 10-30 seconds)

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

You can verify Cloudinary is working by:

1. **Check the test endpoint:**
   ```
   https://yuumpy.com/api/upload/test
   ```
   
   This will show you the configuration status:
   - ‚úÖ **Configured**: All environment variables are set correctly
   - ‚ùå **Not Configured**: Missing one or more environment variables

2. **Try uploading a product image:**
   - Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Add/Edit Product
   - Try uploading an image
   - You should now see a Cloudinary URL instead of an error

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cloudinary is not configured" Error

**Solution:**
- Double-check all three environment variables are set in Cloudpanel
- Make sure there are no typos in variable names (they are case-sensitive)
- Restart your Node.js application after adding/modifying variables

### Issue: "Invalid API Key" Error

**Solution:**
- Verify your API Key and API Secret are correct in Cloudinary Dashboard
- Make sure you copied the complete values (they're long strings)
- Check that you didn't accidentally include quotes or extra spaces

### Issue: "Cloud name not found" Error

**Solution:**
- Verify your Cloud Name is correct
- Cloud Name is usually the name you chose when creating your Cloudinary account
- It should not include the `.cloudinary.com` suffix

### Issue: Images Still Not Uploading

**Solution:**
1. Check your VPS server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify you restarted the Node.js application after setting environment variables
3. Check the `/api/upload/test` endpoint to see configuration status
4. Verify your Cloudinary account is active and not suspended

## üìã Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure these are set in your Cloudpanel:

- [ ] `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- [ ] `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- [ ] `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## üöÄ Alternative: Using .env File (Advanced)

If you prefer managing environment variables via `.env.local` file:

1. SSH into your VPS
2. Navigate to your application directory
3. Create or edit `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
4. Restart your Node.js application

**Note:** Cloudpanel's environment variables are recommended as they're easier to manage through the UI.

## üí° Quick Test

After setup, test the configuration:

```bash
curl https://yuumpy.com/api/upload/test
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cloudinary": {
    "configured": true,
    "status": "‚úÖ Configured",
    "details": {
      "cloudName": "‚úÖ Set (your-cloud-name)",
      "apiKey": "‚úÖ Set",
      "apiSecret": "‚úÖ Set"
    }
  }
}
```
